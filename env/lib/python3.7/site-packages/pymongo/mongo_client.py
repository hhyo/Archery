        """Client for a MongoDB instance, a replica set, or a set of mongoses.

        The client object is thread-safe and has connection-pooling built in.
        If an operation fails because of a network error,
        :class:`~pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure` is raised and the client
        reconnects in the background. Application code should handle this
        exception (recognizing that the operation failed) and then continue to
        execute.

        The `host` parameter can be a full `mongodb URI
        <http://dochub.mongodb.org/core/connections>`_, in addition to
        a simple hostname. It can also be a list of hostnames or
        URIs. Any port specified in the host string(s) will override
        the `port` parameter. If multiple mongodb URIs containing
        database or auth information are passed, the last database,
        username, and password present will be used.  For username and
        passwords reserved characters like ':', '/', '+' and '@' must be
        percent encoded following RFC 2396::

            try:
                # Python 3.x
                from urllib.parse import quote_plus
            except ImportError:
                # Python 2.x
                from urllib import quote_plus

            uri = "mongodb://%s:%s@%s" % (
                quote_plus(user), quote_plus(password), host)
            client = MongoClient(uri)

        Unix domain sockets are also supported. The socket path must be percent
        encoded in the URI::

            uri = "mongodb://%s:%s@%s" % (
                quote_plus(user), quote_plus(password), quote_plus(socket_path))
            client = MongoClient(uri)

        But not when passed as a simple hostname::

            client = MongoClient('/tmp/mongodb-27017.sock')

        Starting with version 3.6, PyMongo supports mongodb+srv:// URIs. The
        URI must include one, and only one, hostname. The hostname will be
        resolved to one or more DNS `SRV records
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record>`_ which will be used
        as the seed list for connecting to the MongoDB deployment. When using
        SRV URIs, the `authSource` and `replicaSet` configuration options can
        be specified using `TXT records
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TXT_record>`_. See the
        `Initial DNS Seedlist Discovery spec
        <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/
        initial-dns-seedlist-discovery/initial-dns-seedlist-discovery.rst>`_
        for more details. Note that the use of SRV URIs implicitly enables
        TLS support. Pass ssl=false in the URI to override.

        .. note:: MongoClient creation will block waiting for answers from
          DNS when mongodb+srv:// URIs are used.

        .. note:: Starting with version 3.0 the :class:`MongoClient`
          constructor no longer blocks while connecting to the server or
          servers, and it no longer raises
          :class:`~pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure` if they are
          unavailable, nor :class:`~pymongo.errors.ConfigurationError`
          if the user's credentials are wrong. Instead, the constructor
          returns immediately and launches the connection process on
          background threads. You can check if the server is available
          like this::

            from pymongo.errors import ConnectionFailure
            client = MongoClient()
            try:
                # The ismaster command is cheap and does not require auth.
                client.admin.command('ismaster')
            except ConnectionFailure:
                print("Server not available")

        .. warning:: When using PyMongo in a multiprocessing context, please
          read :ref:`multiprocessing` first.

        :Parameters:
          - `host` (optional): hostname or IP address or Unix domain socket
            path of a single mongod or mongos instance to connect to, or a
            mongodb URI, or a list of hostnames / mongodb URIs. If `host` is
            an IPv6 literal it must be enclosed in '[' and ']' characters
            following the RFC2732 URL syntax (e.g. '[::1]' for localhost).
            Multihomed and round robin DNS addresses are **not** supported.
          - `port` (optional): port number on which to connect
          - `document_class` (optional): default class to use for
            documents returned from queries on this client
          - `type_registry` (optional): instance of
            :class:`~bson.codec_options.TypeRegistry` to enable encoding
            and decoding of custom types.
          - `tz_aware` (optional): if ``True``,
            :class:`~datetime.datetime` instances returned as values
            in a document by this :class:`MongoClient` will be timezone
            aware (otherwise they will be naive)
          - `connect` (optional): if ``True`` (the default), immediately
            begin connecting to MongoDB in the background. Otherwise connect
            on the first operation.

          | **Other optional parameters can be passed as keyword arguments:**

          - `maxPoolSize` (optional): The maximum allowable number of
            concurrent connections to each connected server. Requests to a
            server will block if there are `maxPoolSize` outstanding
            connections to the requested server. Defaults to 100. Cannot be 0.
          - `minPoolSize` (optional): The minimum required number of concurrent
            connections that the pool will maintain to each connected server.
            Default is 0.
          - `maxIdleTimeMS` (optional): The maximum number of milliseconds that
            a connection can remain idle in the pool before being removed and
            replaced. Defaults to `None` (no limit).
          - `socketTimeoutMS`: (integer or None) Controls how long (in
            milliseconds) the driver will wait for a response after sending an
            ordinary (non-monitoring) database operation before concluding that
            a network error has occurred. Defaults to ``None`` (no timeout).
          - `connectTimeoutMS`: (integer or None) Controls how long (in
            milliseconds) the driver will wait during server monitoring when
            connecting a new socket to a server before concluding the server
            is unavailable. Defaults to ``20000`` (20 seconds).
          - `server_selector`: (callable or None) Optional, user-provided
            function that augments server selection rules. The function should
            accept as an argument a list of
            :class:`~pymongo.server_description.ServerDescription` objects and
            return a list of server descriptions that should be considered
            suitable for the desired operation.
          - `serverSelectionTimeoutMS`: (integer) Controls how long (in
            milliseconds) the driver will wait to find an available,
            appropriate server to carry out a database operation; while it is
            waiting, multiple server monitoring operations may be carried out,
            each controlled by `connectTimeoutMS`. Defaults to ``30000`` (30
            seconds).
          - `waitQueueTimeoutMS`: (integer or None) How long (in milliseconds)
            a thread will wait for a socket from the pool if the pool has no
            free sockets. Defaults to ``None`` (no timeout).
          - `waitQueueMultiple`: (integer or None) Multiplied by maxPoolSize
            to give the number of threads allowed to wait for a socket at one
            time. Defaults to ``None`` (no limit).
          - `heartbeatFrequencyMS`: (optional) The number of milliseconds
            between periodic server checks, or None to accept the default
            frequency of 10 seconds.
          - `appname`: (string or None) The name of the application that
            created this MongoClient instance. MongoDB 3.4 and newer will
            print this value in the server log upon establishing each
            connection. It is also recorded in the slow query log and
            profile collections.
          - `driver`: (pair or None) A driver implemented on top of PyMongo can
            pass a :class:`~pymongo.driver_info.DriverInfo` to add its name,
            version, and platform to the message printed in the server log when
            establishing a connection.
          - `event_listeners`: a list or tuple of event listeners. See
            :mod:`~pymongo.monitoring` for details.
          - `retryWrites`: (boolean) Whether supported write operations
            executed within this MongoClient will be retried once after a
            network error on MongoDB 3.6+. Defaults to ``False``.
            The supported write operations are:

              - :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.bulk_write`, as long as
                :class:`~pymongo.operations.UpdateMany` or
                :class:`~pymongo.operations.DeleteMany` are not included.
              - :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.delete_one`
              - :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.insert_one`
              - :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.insert_many`
              - :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.replace_one`
              - :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.update_one`
              - :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one_and_delete`
              - :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one_and_replace`
              - :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one_and_update`

            Unsupported write operations include, but are not limited to,
            :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.aggregate` using the ``$out``
            pipeline operator and any operation with an unacknowledged write
            concern (e.g. {w: 0})). See
            https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/retryable-writes/retryable-writes.rst
          - `socketKeepAlive`: (boolean) **DEPRECATED** Whether to send
            periodic keep-alive packets on connected sockets. Defaults to
            ``True``. Disabling it is not recommended, see
            https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/faq/diagnostics/#does-tcp-keepalive-time-affect-mongodb-deployments",
          - `compressors`: Comma separated list of compressors for wire
            protocol compression. The list is used to negotiate a compressor
            with the server. Currently supported options are "snappy" and
            "zlib". Support for snappy requires the
            `python-snappy <https://pypi.org/project/python-snappy/>`_ package.
            zlib support requires the Python standard library zlib module.
            By default no compression is used. Compression support must also be
            enabled on the server. MongoDB 3.4+ supports snappy compression.
            MongoDB 3.6+ supports snappy and zlib.
          - `zlibCompressionLevel`: (int) The zlib compression level to use
            when zlib is used as the wire protocol compressor. Supported values
            are -1 through 9. -1 tells the zlib library to use its default
            compression level (usually 6). 0 means no compression. 1 is best
            speed. 9 is best compression. Defaults to -1.
          - `uuidRepresentation`: The BSON representation to use when encoding
            from and decoding to instances of :class:`~uuid.UUID`. Valid
            values are `pythonLegacy` (the default), `javaLegacy`,
            `csharpLegacy` and `standard`. New applications should consider
            setting this to `standard` for cross language compatibility.

          | **Write Concern options:**
          | (Only set if passed. No default values.)

          - `w`: (integer or string) If this is a replica set, write operations
            will block until they have been replicated to the specified number
            or tagged set of servers. `w=<int>` always includes the replica set
            primary (e.g. w=3 means write to the primary and wait until
            replicated to **two** secondaries). Passing w=0 **disables write
            acknowledgement** and all other write concern options.
          - `wtimeout`: (integer) Used in conjunction with `w`. Specify a value
            in milliseconds to control how long to wait for write propagation
            to complete. If replication does not complete in the given
            timeframe, a timeout exception is raised.
          - `j`: If ``True`` block until write operations have been committed
            to the journal. Cannot be used in combination with `fsync`. Prior
            to MongoDB 2.6 this option was ignored if the server was running
            without journaling. Starting with MongoDB 2.6 write operations will
            fail with an exception if this option is used when the server is
            running without journaling.
          - `fsync`: If ``True`` and the server is running without journaling,
            blocks until the server has synced all data files to disk. If the
            server is running with journaling, this acts the same as the `j`
            option, blocking until write operations have been committed to the
            journal. Cannot be used in combination with `j`.

          | **Replica set keyword arguments for connecting with a replica set
            - either directly or via a mongos:**

          - `replicaSet`: (string or None) The name of the replica set to
            connect to. The driver will verify that all servers it connects to
            match this name. Implies that the hosts specified are a seed list
            and the driver should attempt to find all members of the set.
            Defaults to ``None``.

          | **Read Preference:**

          - `readPreference`: The replica set read preference for this client.
            One of ``primary``, ``primaryPreferred``, ``secondary``,
            ``secondaryPreferred``, or ``nearest``. Defaults to ``primary``.
          - `readPreferenceTags`: Specifies a tag set as a comma-separated list
            of colon-separated key-value pairs. For example ``dc:ny,rack:1``.
            Defaults to ``None``.
          - `maxStalenessSeconds`: (integer) The maximum estimated
            length of time a replica set secondary can fall behind the primary
            in replication before it will no longer be selected for operations.
            Defaults to ``-1``, meaning no maximum. If maxStalenessSeconds
            is set, it must be a positive integer greater than or equal to
            90 seconds.

          .. seealso:: :doc:`/examples/server_selection`

          | **Authentication:**

          - `username`: A string.
          - `password`: A string.

            Although username and password must be percent-escaped in a MongoDB
            URI, they must not be percent-escaped when passed as parameters. In
            this example, both the space and slash special characters are passed
            as-is::

              MongoClient(username="user name", password="pass/word")

          - `authSource`: The database to authenticate on. Defaults to the
            database specified in the URI, if provided, or to "admin".
          - `authMechanism`: See :data:`~pymongo.auth.MECHANISMS` for options.
            If no mechanism is specified, PyMongo automatically uses MONGODB-CR
            when connected to a pre-3.0 version of MongoDB, SCRAM-SHA-1 when
            connected to MongoDB 3.0 through 3.6, and negotiates the mechanism
            to use (SCRAM-SHA-1 or SCRAM-SHA-256) when connected to MongoDB
            4.0+.
          - `authMechanismProperties`: Used to specify authentication mechanism
            specific options. To specify the service name for GSSAPI
            authentication pass authMechanismProperties='SERVICE_NAME:<service
            name>'

          .. seealso:: :doc:`/examples/authentication`

          | **SSL configuration:**

          - `ssl`: If ``True``, create the connection to the server using SSL.
            Defaults to ``False``.
          - `ssl_certfile`: The certificate file used to identify the local
            connection against mongod. Implies ``ssl=True``. Defaults to
            ``None``.
          - `ssl_keyfile`: The private keyfile used to identify the local
            connection against mongod.  If included with the ``certfile`` then
            only the ``ssl_certfile`` is needed.  Implies ``ssl=True``.
            Defaults to ``None``.
          - `ssl_pem_passphrase`: The password or passphrase for decrypting
            the private key in ``ssl_certfile`` or ``ssl_keyfile``. Only
            necessary if the private key is encrypted. Only supported by python
            2.7.9+ (pypy 2.5.1+) and 3.3+. Defaults to ``None``.
          - `ssl_cert_reqs`: Specifies whether a certificate is required from
            the other side of the connection, and whether it will be validated
            if provided. It must be one of the three values ``ssl.CERT_NONE``
            (certificates ignored), ``ssl.CERT_REQUIRED`` (certificates
            required and validated), or ``ssl.CERT_OPTIONAL`` (the same as
            CERT_REQUIRED, unless the server was configured to use anonymous
            ciphers). If the value of this parameter is not ``ssl.CERT_NONE``
            and a value is not provided for ``ssl_ca_certs`` PyMongo will
            attempt to load system provided CA certificates. If the python
            version in use does not support loading system CA certificates
            then the ``ssl_ca_certs`` parameter must point to a file of CA
            certificates. Implies ``ssl=True``. Defaults to
            ``ssl.CERT_REQUIRED`` if not provided and ``ssl=True``.
          - `ssl_ca_certs`: The ca_certs file contains a set of concatenated
            "certification authority" certificates, which are used to validate
            certificates passed from the other end of the connection.
            Implies ``ssl=True``. Defaults to ``None``.
          - `ssl_crlfile`: The path to a PEM or DER formatted certificate
            revocation list. Only supported by python 2.7.9+ (pypy 2.5.1+)
            and 3.4+. Defaults to ``None``.
          - `ssl_match_hostname`: If ``True`` (the default), and
            `ssl_cert_reqs` is not ``ssl.CERT_NONE``, enables hostname
            verification using the :func:`~ssl.match_hostname` function from
            python's :mod:`~ssl` module. Think very carefully before setting
            this to ``False`` as that could make your application vulnerable to
            man-in-the-middle attacks.

          | **Read Concern options:**
          | (If not set explicitly, this will use the server default)

          - `readConcernLevel`: (string) The read concern level specifies the
            level of isolation for read operations.  For example, a read
            operation using a read concern level of ``majority`` will only
            return data that has been written to a majority of nodes. If the
            level is left unspecified, the server default will be used.

        .. mongodoc:: connections

        .. versionchanged:: 3.8
           Added the ``server_selector`` keyword argument.
           Added the ``type_registry`` keyword argument.

        .. versionchanged:: 3.7
           Added the ``driver`` keyword argument.

        .. versionchanged:: 3.6
           Added support for mongodb+srv:// URIs.
           Added the ``retryWrites`` keyword argument and URI option.

        .. versionchanged:: 3.5
           Add ``username`` and ``password`` options. Document the
           ``authSource``, ``authMechanism``, and ``authMechanismProperties ``
           options.
           Deprecated the `socketKeepAlive` keyword argument and URI option.
           `socketKeepAlive` now defaults to ``True``.

        .. versionchanged:: 3.0
           :class:`~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient` is now the one and only
           client class for a standalone server, mongos, or replica set.
           It includes the functionality that had been split into
           :class:`~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoReplicaSetClient`: it can connect
           to a replica set, discover all its members, and monitor the set for
           stepdowns, elections, and reconfigs.

           The :class:`~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient` constructor no
           longer blocks while connecting to the server or servers, and it no
           longer raises :class:`~pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure` if they
           are unavailable, nor :class:`~pymongo.errors.ConfigurationError`
           if the user's credentials are wrong. Instead, the constructor
           returns immediately and launches the connection process on
           background threads.

           Therefore the ``alive`` method is removed since it no longer
           provides meaningful information; even if the client is disconnected,
           it may discover a server in time to fulfill the next operation.

           In PyMongo 2.x, :class:`~pymongo.MongoClient` accepted a list of
           standalone MongoDB servers and used the first it could connect to::

               MongoClient(['host1.com:27017', 'host2.com:27017'])

           A list of multiple standalones is no longer supported; if multiple
           servers are listed they must be members of the same replica set, or
           mongoses in the same sharded cluster.

           The behavior for a list of mongoses is changed from "high
           availability" to "load balancing". Before, the client connected to
           the lowest-latency mongos in the list, and used it until a network
           error prompted it to re-evaluate all mongoses' latencies and
           reconnect to one of them. In PyMongo 3, the client monitors its
           network latency to all the mongoses continuously, and distributes
           operations evenly among those with the lowest latency. See
           :ref:`mongos-load-balancing` for more information.

           The ``connect`` option is added.

           The ``start_request``, ``in_request``, and ``end_request`` methods
           are removed, as well as the ``auto_start_request`` option.

           The ``copy_database`` method is removed, see the
           :doc:`copy_database examples </examples/copydb>` for alternatives.

           The :meth:`MongoClient.disconnect` method is removed; it was a
           synonym for :meth:`~pymongo.MongoClient.close`.

           :class:`~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient` no longer returns an
           instance of :class:`~pymongo.database.Database` for attribute names
           with leading underscores. You must use dict-style lookups instead::

               client['__my_database__']

            to the ``$changeStream`` stage. Allowed values: 'default',
            'updateLookup'.  Defaults to 'default'.
            When set to 'updateLookup', the change notification for partial

            changed from some time after the change occurred.
          - `resume_after` (optional): The logical starting point for this
            change stream.
          - `max_await_time_ms` (optional): The maximum time in milliseconds
            for the server to wait for changes before responding to a getMore
            operation.
          - `batch_size` (optional): The maximum number of documents to return
            per batch.
          - `collation` (optional): The :class:`~pymongo.collation.Collation`
            to use for the aggregation.
          - `start_at_operation_time` (optional): If provided, the resulting
            change stream will only return changes that occurred at or after
            the specified :class:`~bson.timestamp.Timestamp`. Requires
            MongoDB >= 4.0.
