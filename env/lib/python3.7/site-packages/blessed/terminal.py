        to be read immediately after it is pressed, Raw mode disables
        processing of input and output.

        In cbreak mode, special input characters such as ``^C`` or ``^S`` are
        interpreted by the terminal driver and excluded from the stdin stream.
        In raw mode these values are receive by the :meth:`inkey` method.
