/**
  We maintain a set of all registered threads.
  We provide accessors (global_thread_list_begin, global_thread_list_end)
  to iterate over all threads. There is no guarantee on the order of THDs
  when iterating. The caller of these two accessors is expected to
  hold lock on LOCK_thread_count mutex before calling these accessors inorder
  to make sure that there are no new threads are added to the system while
  processing this thread list.

  We also provide mutators for inserting, and removing an element:
    > add_global_thread() inserts a THD into the set, and increments the counter.
       The caller of this function is expected to hold lock on LOCK_thread_count
       mutex before calling this function to avoid any parallel operations
       happening on the set.
    > remove_global_thread() removes a THD from the set, and decrements the counter.
       This function acquires lock on LOCK_thd_remove followed by lock on
       LOCK_thread_count. At the end of the function, it releases both the
       locks. remove_global_thread() also broadcasts COND_thread_count.

  We also provide a function (copy_global_thread_list) to copy global thread list
  into a new set. The caller of this function is expected to hold lock on
  LOCK_thd_remove to avoid any removal from the copied set. This function also
  acquires lock on LOCK_thread_count before the copy operation to
  avoid any parallel modification to the set and will release the lock at the
  end of the function.
