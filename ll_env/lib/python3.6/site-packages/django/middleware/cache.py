"""
Cache middleware. If enabled, each Django-powered page will be cached based on
URL. The canonical way to enable cache middleware is to set
``UpdateCacheMiddleware`` as your first piece of middleware, and
``FetchFromCacheMiddleware`` as the last::

    MIDDLEWARE = [
        'django.middleware.cache.UpdateCacheMiddleware',
        ...
        'django.middleware.cache.FetchFromCacheMiddleware'
    ]

This is counter-intuitive, but correct: ``UpdateCacheMiddleware`` needs to run
last during the response phase, which processes middleware bottom-up;
``FetchFromCacheMiddleware`` needs to run last during the request phase, which
processes middleware top-down.

The single-class ``CacheMiddleware`` can be used for some simple sites.
However, if any other piece of middleware needs to affect the cache key, you'll
need to use the two-part ``UpdateCacheMiddleware`` and
``FetchFromCacheMiddleware``. This'll most often happen when you're using
Django's ``LocaleMiddleware``.

More details about how the caching works:

* Only GET or HEAD-requests with status code 200 are cached.

* The number of seconds each page is stored for is set by the "max-age" section
  of the response's "Cache-Control" header, falling back to the
  CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_SECONDS setting if the section was not found.

* This middleware expects that a HEAD request is answered with the same response
  headers exactly like the corresponding GET request.

* When a hit occurs, a shallow copy of the original response object is returned
  from process_request.

* Pages will be cached based on the contents of the request headers listed in
  the response's "Vary" header.

* This middleware also sets ETag, Last-Modified, Expires and Cache-Control
  headers on the response object.
