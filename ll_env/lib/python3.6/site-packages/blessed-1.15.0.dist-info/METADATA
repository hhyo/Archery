Introduction
============

Blessed is a thin, practical wrapper around terminal capabilities in Python.

Coding with *Blessed* looks like this...

.. code-block:: python

    from blessed import Terminal

    t = Terminal()

    print(t.bold('Hi there!'))
    print(t.bold_red_on_bright_green('It hurts my eyes!'))

    with t.location(0, t.height - 1):
        print(t.center(t.blink('press any key to continue.')))

    with t.cbreak():
        inp = t.inkey()
    print('You pressed ' + repr(inp))


Brief Overview
--------------

*Blessed* is a more simplified wrapper around curses_, providing :

* Styles, color, and maybe a little positioning without necessarily
  clearing the whole screen first.
* Works great with standard Python string formatting.
* Provides up-to-the-moment terminal height and width, so you can respond to
  terminal size changes.
* Avoids making a mess if the output gets piped to a non-terminal:
  outputs to any file-like object such as *StringIO*, files, or pipes.
* Uses the `terminfo(5)`_ database so it works with any terminal type
  and supports any terminal capability: No more C-like calls to tigetstr_
  and tparm_.
* Keeps a minimum of internal state, so you can feel free to mix and match with
  calls to curses or whatever other terminal libraries you like.
* Provides plenty of context managers to safely express terminal modes,
  automatically restoring the terminal to a safe state on exit.
* Act intelligently when somebody redirects your output to a file, omitting
  all of the terminal sequences such as styling, colors, or positioning.
* Dead-simple keyboard handling: safely decoding unicode input in your
  system's preferred locale and supports application/arrow keys.
* Allows the printable length of strings containing sequences to be
  determined.

Blessed **does not** provide...

* Windows command prompt support.  A PDCurses_ build of python for windows
  provides only partial support at this time -- there are plans to merge with
  the ansi_ module in concert with colorama_ to resolve this.  `Patches
  welcome <https://github.com/jquast/blessed/issues/18>`_!


Before And After
----------------

With the built-in curses_ module, this is how you would typically
print some underlined text at the bottom of the screen:

.. code-block:: python

    from curses import tigetstr, setupterm, tparm
    from fcntl import ioctl
    from os import isatty
    import struct
    import sys
    from termios import TIOCGWINSZ

    # If we want to tolerate having our output piped to other commands or
    # files without crashing, we need to do all this branching:
    if hasattr(sys.stdout, 'fileno') and isatty(sys.stdout.fileno()):
        setupterm()
        sc = tigetstr('sc')
        cup = tigetstr('cup')
        rc = tigetstr('rc')
        underline = tigetstr('smul')
        normal = tigetstr('sgr0')
    else:
        sc = cup = rc = underline = normal = ''

    # Save cursor position.
    print(sc)

    if cup:
        # tigetnum('lines') doesn't always update promptly, hence this:
        height = struct.unpack('hhhh', ioctl(0, TIOCGWINSZ, '\000' * 8))[0]

        # Move cursor to bottom.
        print(tparm(cup, height - 1, 0))

    print('This is {under}underlined{normal}!'
          .format(under=underline, normal=normal))

    # Restore cursor position.
    print(rc)

The same program with *Blessed* is simply:

.. code-block:: python

    from blessed import Terminal

    term = Terminal()
    with term.location(0, term.height - 1):
        print('This is' + term.underline('underlined') + '!')

Requirements
------------

*Blessed* is tested with Python 2.7, 3.4, and 3.5 on Debian Linux, Mac, and
FreeBSD.
